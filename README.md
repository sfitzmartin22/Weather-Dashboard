# Your Project Title
Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project's goal is to create and deploy an application that allows a user to search for the current weather and the 5-day forecast for a city.  Past searches will be saved in order to toggle back and forth from recently searched cities.  I used the local storage to save user submitted information and display it on the webpage after the search button has been hit.  I used the fetch method to retrieve data from the third party weather API in order to populate all the information on this application.

## User Instructions
the user should enter a city into the search bar and hit search.  The Temperature/Humidity/wind speed will show-up along with an icon based on what type of weather it currently is.  A five day forecast will also appear.  Old searches will be saved for ease of use.
